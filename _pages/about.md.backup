## About Me

My name is Kenny and I am an undergraduate student studying Mathematical Physics.

This blog is a place for me to store write-ups, projects, and my thoughts. 

This site is powered by Jekyll and a fork of the [reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) theme. It is hosted on Github Pages.
