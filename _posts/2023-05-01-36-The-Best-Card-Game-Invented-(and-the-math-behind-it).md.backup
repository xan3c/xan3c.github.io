## Introducing 24: The Predecessor

There is this card game called "24" that evolved out of Shanghai. It is incredibly simple and is endlessly fun (I have played hours and hours of 24). To play, you remove the face cards from a regular deck of cards and deal four cards face up. With these four cards, you must make the number "24" using only the four basic operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, you must use every card and you can only use each card once. You can play by yourself, one-on-one, or as a party game with an unlimited amount of players. The first person to find a way of making 24 gets a point and you deal four new cards.

### Example
**Cards Dealt:** 4, 8, 3, 2

For example, if we were dealt four random cards like above, we can make 24 by (4 + 2 - 3) * 8.

## The Problem With 24

The problem with 24 is that all of my friends *hate* it. Some of them actively get angry at the mention of the game. It is not a passive or understated disdain, they loathe it with **zeal**. 


## 36: The New and Exciting Card Game

In order to entice my friends to play with me again, I invented a new card game: 36 !

Unlike 24, the players try to make 36 out of the cards dealt. And you deal **five** cards instead of **four** per hand. One caveat of this is that you must have two decks of cards (with the face cards removed), as there are only four of each number in a standard deck (you have two decks so that you can deal five of a kind).

### Example

**Cards Dealt:** 3, 3, 3, 3, 3

In this example, we can make 36 by: 3 \* 3 \* 3 + 3 \* 3

## The Math Behind 36

If you were just interested in the card game, you can stop reading here.

A lot of people at this point wonder: "Can you make 24 (or 36) from every possible hand dealt?" It might not come as a surprise, but the answer is no. You need not look further than the hand [1, 1, 1, 1], you can't make a number big enough to approach 24. 

One interesting fact though, is that with 36, a higher percentage of hands dealt are viable compared to 24. The data is summarized in the following table:
